First and foremost, thank you for your interest in FeOphant! This project is my current hobby despite raising young kids and having a demanding job. I would love to hear from you via linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hotchkiss/) or reddit (u/chotchki).

With that said this project is in no way production ready at this time. Further more due to my day responsibilities my ability to respond to issues, pull requests or anything is extremely limited. **Please** reach out before you invest any time into this project.

My goal is as a part of reaching a 1.0 minimum viable product release to setup the mechanisms for the above statements to change. That also includes figuring out the long term licensing of this project and even its name.
